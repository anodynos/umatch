A `function(filename, specs)` thats checks if `'someFile.ext'` passes through an of Array of `minimatch` / `RegExp` / `callbacks` / `Array` (recursive) specs, with negation/exclusion '!' flag for all.

_Note: `umatch` replaces the deprecated [`is_file_in`](http://github.com/anodynos/is_file_in) with extending behavior._


## Simple Usage

```
 var umatch = require('umatch');

 umatch('myfile.txt', ['**/*.txt']) // true

 umatch('myfile.txt', ['**/*.txt', '!my*']) // false

```
## File specs

The Array of filename specifications (or simply filenames), can expressed in either:

  * `String` in *gruntjs*'s-like expand `minimatch` format (eg `'**/*.coffee'`) and its exclusion cousin (eg `'!**/DRAFT*.*'`)


  * `RegExp`s that matche filenames (eg `/./`) again with a negation / exclusion pattern.

    ```
    [..., '!', /regexp/, ...]
    ```


  * A `function(filename){}` callback, returning `true` if filename is to be matched. Consistently it can have a negation / exclusion flag before it:


    ```
    [..., '!', function(f){ return f === 'excludeMe.js' }, ...]
    ```

    Note the trap with negation flag: always use a `true` (i.e matched) as the function result, preceded by '!' for **exclusion**. Only the `true` return value is considered by `umatch` (which means **it matched**), and the possible exclusion before it excludes those that did actually match. In other words, you will be happy to know that, `['!', function(){return false}]` does NOT mean *include all*, only `[ function(){return true} ]` does.

    The common trap is to return a `false` for your *excluded matches* (which means nothing) and then all your non-excluded will match with `true`, which is probably not what you want! Instead use a `true` (i.e match) and then use the negation '!' before the function.

    As a rule of thumb remember that double negation (exclusion + false) is NOT positive (inclusion).


  * An `Array<String|RegExp|Function|Array>, recursive, i.e


     ```
     [ ..., '!', ['DontAllowMe*.*', function(f){ return f === 'excludeme.js' }, [.., []], ...], ...]
     ```

  The same rules for `Function` apply here: only matched filenames are considered for inclusion, or exclusion if the array is preceded by `'!'`.

# Examples

```javascript

  var specs = [
    '**/recources/*',
    '!badFile.json',
    /.*\.someExtension$/i,
    '!', /.*\.excludeExtension$/i,
    function(fn) { return fn === 'includedFile.ext' },
    '!', function(fn) { return _.startsWith('DRAFT') }
  ];

  umatch('someFile.someExtension', specs) // true

  umatch('someFile.otherExtension', specs) // false

  umatch('includedFile.ext', specs) //true

  umatch('DRAFTFile.ext', specs) // false

```
